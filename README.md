### Frontend
| Tool | Purpose |

| React 18 | UI framework |
| React Router DOM | Client-side routing |
| Styled Components | Component-level styling |
| Axios | HTTP requests |
| React Icons | Icon library |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

---

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd starbooks
```

---

### Step 2 — Install all dependencies

You can install everything at once from the root folder:

```bash
npm run install:all
```

Or install each part manually:

```bash
# Backend
cd server
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../front
npm install
```

---

### Step 3 — Run the application

#### Option A — Run both at once (recommended)

From the root folder:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both the backend and frontend simultaneously.

#### Option B — Run each separately

Open **two terminals**:

**Terminal 1 — Backend:**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 — Frontend:**
```bash
cd front
npm start
```

---

### Step 4 — Open in the browser

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend (React app) | http://localhost:3000 |
| Backend (API) | http://localhost:8000 |

> ⚠️ **Both servers must be running at the same time** for the app to work correctly.
